## 🔧 Troubleshooting Mode

This application includes comprehensive troubleshooting features to identify and resolve rendering issues. If you're experiencing problems with the main application, we've provided several diagnostic tools to help pinpoint where the problem occurs.

### Using the Gradual Testing App

The Gradual Testing App allows you to enable features incrementally to identify which components or integrations might be causing issues.

1. Click the "Gradual App" button in the top navigation
2. Start by enabling basic features like "Local Storage"
3. Test each feature after enabling it
4. Add more complex components one by one
5. Check the logs and errors tabs for any issues

### Testing UI Components

For issues specifically with UI rendering:

1. Click the "Component Test" button in the Gradual Testing App
2. Select individual UI components to test them in isolation
3. Try different properties and configurations
4. Watch for any render errors or console warnings

## 📋 Module Descriptions

### Cost Analysis
The Cost Analysis module helps businesses understand their cost structure, calculate margins, and determine break-even points. It supports:
- Direct cost calculation (materials, labor, per-unit costs)
- Indirect cost allocation (overhead, marketing, administration)
- Time-based cost tracking (for service businesses)
- Margin calculation and break-even analysis
- Data import/export capabilities

### Customer Segments
The Customer Segments module helps businesses analyze and optimize pricing for different customer groups:
- Define segments with varying price sensitivity levels
- Visualize price sensitivity across customer segments
- Get segment-specific pricing recommendations
- Create tailored implementation plans for each segment

### Pricing Strategy
The Pricing Strategy module generates optimal price recommendations based on:
- Cost-plus pricing (ensuring target margins)
- Competitor-based pricing (market positioning)
- Value-based pricing (charging based on delivered value)
- Custom blended approaches for balanced recommendations

### Scenario Comparison
The Scenario Comparison module allows businesses to create and compare different pricing strategies:
- Save different pricing configurations as named scenarios
- Compare multiple scenarios side by side
- Analyze key pricing metrics across scenarios
- See detailed differences between scenarios
- Import/export scenarios for sharing or backup

### Value Assessment
The Value Assessment module helps businesses articulate and communicate their value proposition with four key components:
1. **Competitive Analysis**: Compare your offering to competitors
2. **Value Proposition Editor**: Craft a clear value statement
3. **Value Mapping**: Connect your value to customer needs
4. **Value Communication**: Create a plan to communicate your value effectively

## 🧪 Development and Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
npm run test
```

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

### Testing Individual Components

The application includes a Component Test utility for testing UI components in isolation:

1. Run the application in development mode
2. Click on "Gradual App" in the navigation
3. Click on "Component Test" in the top right
4. Select a component to test from the left sidebar
5. Adjust properties and observe rendering

## 📝 Documentation

Detailed component documentation is available in the `docs` directory:

- [CostStructureForm](docs/CostStructureForm.md) - Cost structure input form
- [CostDataImport](docs/CostDataImport.md) - Cost data import functionality

## ⚠️ Common Issues and Solutions

### App Not Rendering

If the main app isn't rendering correctly:

1. Try the simplified or gradual app versions
2. Use the component test to check if UI components render individually
3. Check the browser console for JavaScript errors
4. Verify Tailwind CSS is loading properly (look for styled elements)

### Storage Issues

If you're experiencing problems with data persistence:

1. In the Gradual App, enable the "Local Storage" feature
2. Click "Test Storage" to verify reading/writing works
3. Check browser console for any localStorage-related errors
4. Ensure your browser has localStorage enabled and available

### Component Rendering Problems

If specific components aren't rendering:

1. Use the Component Test to isolate the problematic component
2. Try different property combinations
3. Check the error log for specific rendering errors
4. Look for dependency issues (one component might require another to be enabled)

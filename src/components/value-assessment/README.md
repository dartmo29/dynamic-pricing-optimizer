3. Apply **ValueMapping** to connect that value to customer needs
4. Develop your **ValueCommunication** plan to effectively communicate your value

## Integration with Main Application

These components are integrated into the ValueAssessmentPage, which provides a tabbed interface for moving through the assessment workflow.

## Technologies Used

- React for component architecture
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Lucide React for icons
- Radix UI for base components (Card, Dialog, etc.)

## Testing

Test versions of these components are available in the `/components/testing` directory, which allow for isolated testing of each component.

## Future Enhancements

Planned future enhancements include:
- Value assessment templates for different industries
- Enhanced visualization options for competitive data
- Value measurement and ROI calculator tools
- Integration with pricing optimization features
